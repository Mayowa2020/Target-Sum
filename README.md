# Two-Sum Algorithm Challenge

## Question

Given an array of integer numbers and an integer target, you are to create a function that returns the two numbers that add up to the target.
You can return the answer in any order.

Constraints
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you are not allowed to use the same element twice.
Only one valid answer exists

## Testing the Code

console.log(solution([2, 7, 11, 15], 9));

    answer = [2, 7]

console.log(solution([3, 2, 4], 6));

    answer = [2, 4]

console.log(solution([2, 1, 5, 3], 4));

    answer = [1, 3]
